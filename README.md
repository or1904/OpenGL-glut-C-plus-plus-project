# OpenGL-glut-C-plus-plus-project
My final year project in high school. This project is an FPS shooter single player game. 
If you are intersted in using some of the parts of my code, please credit me in your project.

- please noitce i dont not own the built-in libraries and the multi-input code.

# How to download the project
! This project was coded on visual studio community 2019 and might not run smooth with another work environment or later/early versions.

- make sure glut is installed and set.
- download the zip file and unzip the files in it.
- arrange the files so the headers files in your header folder and the cpp files in your source folder.
